## LSB - Linux Standard Base-compliant
LSB executables are used stored in executable and Linkable Format (ELF) 

To extract data from these files, you can use various commands:

strings - get hidden text within the binary/executable

### Finding out about symbols included in an ELF executable file or library
ldd - to find out the libraries used as dynamic links by an executable file in ELF format

pldd - specify the process ID and view the libraries used by the process in its operation

nm - information about symbols included in the file is displayed

pbjdump - you can get information even if symbol information is not included in the ELF executable file. This command is often used to find out which functions are used in the file.

### Understanding what happens when an ELF executable file is run
strace - displays the system calls when a command is executed
ltrace - ltrace displays the functions, arguments, and results of the executed command in the standard error output
